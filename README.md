# Quiz Application  

A simple Quiz Application built using **Java**, **Swing**, and **AWT**. This application provides an interactive graphical user interface for users to participate in quizzes and test their knowledge. 

The Quiz Application is a user-friendly desktop-based program designed to deliver an interactive and engaging quiz experience. Developed using **Java**, **Swing**, and **AWT**, this application combines the robust capabilities of Java with intuitive graphical elements to create a visually appealing and functional interface. It allows users to participate in multiple-choice quizzes, where they can select answers, track their progress, and receive instant feedback on their performance. The app features a timer to make the quizzes more challenging and dynamic, encouraging users to think quickly and accurately. At the end of the quiz, participants are presented with their scores, helping them gauge their knowledge and identify areas for improvement.

The application's modular design makes it easy to customize and expand. Developers can easily modify the question bank by editing a predefined file or adjusting the relevant classes within the project. Additionally, the timer duration and other quiz settings can be tweaked to suit specific requirements, such as creating quizzes for educational purposes, training sessions, or general knowledge tests. By leveraging Swing for GUI components and AWT for event handling, the application ensures a seamless user experience with responsive controls and clean layouts.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Java, as it demonstrates key programming concepts like object-oriented design, event-driven programming, and file handling. Moreover, it serves as a practical example of building desktop applications with Java's GUI libraries. The Quiz Application is not only a fun and educational tool for end users but also a valuable learning resource for developers seeking to enhance their skills in Java application development.
